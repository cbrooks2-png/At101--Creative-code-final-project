<h1> Hi! My name is Midias </h1> <text-align> <left> </text-align> 
<h2> So, it seems like you are interested in money, ME TO!</h2>
<h1> <u>Section 1: How does money work? </u>
<h3> First, lets define what money is. Money is anything that can be used as an exchange for goods and services. This ranges from your weekly groceries, your online shopping addiction, yes I know, to services such as a taxi ride or doctors appointments. Money is used everywhere. <text-align>right</text-align>   </h3>
<h3> In the United States, The U.S. Dollar is used as our medium of exchange. The U.S. dollar dollar is a little piece of paper, which we call a bill,  that has been assigned a value. These have been assigned a value ranging from 1 to 100 dollars. </h3>
<h1> <u>Section 2: What are Taxes and why do I pay them? </u> 
<h3> So you want to learn about taxes, everyones favorite!!!</h3>
<h3>There are two different kinds of taxes in the United States, Federal tax and State taxes. </h3>
<h3>Federal taxes are taxes you pay to the federal government. Within federal taxes there are different kinds of taxes. Some of the most common federal taxes are Individual income tax, payroll tax, corporate income tax, excise tax, estate tax, and tariffs.</h3>
<h3>Individual income tax: % of your total income; wage, salary, investment and other earnings you may have</h3>
<h4>Payroll tax: When you get a job, or if you already have one, you will be charged something called a Payroll Tax. This is a percentage of your paycheck that goes to the government to fund certain programs such as social security, unemployment insurance and medicare. It physically hurts every time I open my paycheck and I see how much was taken out for payroll tax. At least it is going to some good programs</h4>
<h4> Corporate income tax: If you are ever dealing with corporate tax, CONGRATULATION! It seems like you gravitate to running your own business. A Corporate income tax is a tax by the state or federal government directly on a company's net profit. If this number is high, that means you made A LOT of money, which is awesome! At the federal level, there is a 21% tax rate on net profit. Depending on which state you live in, the tax rate at the state level may vary.  </h4>
<h4>Excise tax: Ever heard of an excise tax? Thought you might not have. An excise tax is an indirect tax levied by federal, state, and local governments on specific goods, services. Unlike general sales tax, excise taxes are typically included in the product's price. Some common examples of excise taxes or fuel tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, don’t do drugs kids, and transportation tax. As I said before, these taxes are already calculated into the cost of the goods so I wouldn't worry about it too much.</h4>
<h4>Estate tax: This is a dark one that I hope you don’t have to deal with anytime soon. An Estate tax is a tax on the total value of a deceased person's assets. This includes cash, houses, and other things of value. Hopefully you won’t have to deal with that for a long time. </h4>
<h4>Tariffs: The talk of the town currently. Tariffs are something the government imposes against foreign goods. These taxes are paid by the businesses that import goods from other countries. For example, you buy an action figure from some online store. That company then pays a percentage of the value of the good to the government. With everything going on, it is important to understand exactly what this is even though you may not be dealing with them directly. </h4>
<h1> <u>Section 3: Budgeting </u>
<h3>So you want to learn hot to buget. Well it might differ for each individual person, I can give you some basic advice on how you may want to budget</h3>
<h4> First up is the 50/30/20 rule. This rule says you should allocate 50% of after-tax income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment. Another simple approach is the 80/20 rule, which suggests saving 20% and using the remaining 80% for all other expenses.</h4>

  <p> Generation Z, my generation, is by far the most financially illiterate generation. (Insert name of character)’s goal is to spread financial knowledge to those who may not be able to otherwise learn it. This is meant to lower the barrier of entry for young people to be able to learn basic financial knowledge that will hopefully set them up for success in the future. My hope is that from this is that people look at this and are encouraged to go out and learn more about personal finance. Hopefully this is your first step into expanding your financial knowledge! </p>
